# MCPlatformer Beta
This is a platforming game using Minecraft textures.

Note: this fork from the original (https://github.com/jimmy-gnahz/MT-Clone-), and this fork will act like a dev build. I will push versions of this fork that are confirmed to be working to the main project. 

By the way, one of the files in my project exceeded the 100MB mark, so I can't push projects up here anymore. I'll sort out file pointers when I have time
